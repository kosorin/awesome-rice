# Installation
### Manual
Backup your current config and download the files from GitHub to the empty `~/.config/awesome` directory:

    $ git clone https://github.com/kosorin/awesome-rice.git ~/.config/awesome

### Auto Installer
You may use our autoinstall script, which is only supported on Arch Linux for now (this does not configure your .xinitrc) 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kosorin/awesome-rice.git ~/arice
cd arice
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
- Be aware we always recommend manual installation as everyone's computer is different, and sometimes there might be problems depending on what you have installed

# Setup

Some [dependencies](#dependencies) are not listed and can be changed in `config.lua` file. So go ahead and set up your preferred applications.
